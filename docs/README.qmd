## üéì About

This project is a template for creating a **fairness analysis of students' progression in educational institutions in The Netherlands**. The template is based on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) framework and uses the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) coding standard. The template is developed by the [Learning Technology & Analytics (LTA)](https://www.dehaagsehogeschool.nl/onderzoek/lectoraten/learning-technology-analytics)
research group of The Hague University of Applied Sciences for the [Npuls CEDA](https://community-data-ai.npuls.nl/groups/view/44d20066-53a8-48c2-b4e9-be348e05d273/project-center-for-educational-data-analytics-ceda) project project.

## üöÄ Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing. See the [deployment](#deployment) for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To start working with this project, make sure you have the following software installed following the links provided:

**R, Rstudio, Quarto, XQuartz (for Mac only)**

- RStudio version 2024.12.0 or higher with R version 4.4.2 or higher - [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- XQuartz 2.8.5 or higher (for Mac only) - [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
- Quarto version 1.6.39 or higher - [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

**Github, GitHub Desktop**

- A Github account and (optionally) GitHub Desktop version 3.4.16 - [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)

**GFortran**

- GFortran - [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/en/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/). Installation will take several minutes. 

**R packages, fonts**

- All other packages are installed automatically by running the project `_Setup.R` file on your local machine. Instructions are below.
- The installation of the Liter font is optional - [Google](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Liter). Follow the instructions from Google to install this font. 

### Installing

1. First, make a fork of the repository to your own Github account. Then clone the repository to your local machine using the following commands or GitHub Desktop. See [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for an explanation.
2. Once you have cloned the repository, open the project in RStudio and run the `_Setup.R` file by clicking on 'Source'. Don't change any settings yet. This action will install all the necessary packages and fonts.

## üìö Rendering your first fairness reports

### Render the `_basic` project using the default settings

Run the `_basic` project using the default settings. 

- You will create a report for The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS) with the default settings. The report is based on synthesized data from the bachelor's Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD), and will be created in the `_basic` folder of your project. 
- The first time you create this report, it will take several minutes. 
- Once the rendering has finished, click on _basic/index.html and choose `View in Web Browser`. The report will open in your default browser. 
- If you don't see this file, click the refresh icon at the top right of the folder. If you still don't see the report, check the console for any errors. 
- When you rerun the report, the output will be removed and a new report will be created. If you want to keep the previously rendered output, copy the entire folder to a location outside of your project.

**To render the project, follow these steps:**

Since the template has several dependencies, you must render the pages using the terminal.

1. Open a terminal in RStudio (second tab at the bottom of your screen).
2. Run the following command for the _basic_ report:

``` r
quarto render --profile basic
```

### Render the `_advanced` project using the default settings

Next, run the `_advanced` project using the default settings. 

- This time, you will create an extended report. It contains more detailed information about the fairness analysis: prediction models, R-code and an explanation of each step with references. 
- You will create the report on the same synthesized data from the bachelor's Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD), but this time in the `_advanced` folder.
- Once finished, click on _advanced/index.html and choose `View in Web Browser`. 
- The first time you create this report, it will take several minutes. The report will open in your default browser. 
- If you don't see this file, click the refresh icon at the top right of the folder. If you still don't see the report, check the console for errors.
- When you rerun the report, the output will be removed and a new report will be created. If you want to keep the previously rendered output, copy the entire folder to a location outside of your project.

**To render the project, follow these steps:**

Since the template has several dependencies, you must render the pages using the terminal.

1. Open a terminal in RStudio (second tab at the bottom of your screen).
2. Run the following command for the _advanced_ report:

``` r
quarto render --profile advanced
```

### Create and render your institutional reports

Finally, you can create your institutional report by changing the settings in the `_quarto.yml` file. 

- You can change the settings for the layout, the educational institution, faculty or academy, the study program, the report's version, the success factors, the model, the use of synthetic data, the recreation of plots, the enrollment selection and the includes. 
- Start small and work your way up to more complex settings. 
- Follow the [Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) to learn how to create and render your institutional reports.

## üèÅ Deployment

The reports are created in the `_basic` and `advanced` folders. You can deploy the reports to a web server or share them with others by copying the folder to a location outside your project. You can also share the reports by uploading them to a web server or by using a service like GitHub Pages. 

## üí° Learn more on fairness, awareness, and equity

To learn more about the concepts of Fairness, Awareness, and Equity, read the inaugural speech [No Fairness without Awareness](https://zenodo.org/records/14204674) by Theo Bakker.

## üî® Built with

* [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) - The web framework used with R.
* [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) - The R coding standard used.
* [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) - The R package used to build the prediction models.
* [Dalex](https://dalex.drwhy.ai/) - The R package used to explain the prediction models and create the fairness analysis. The implementation of the fairness analysis is based on the [Fairness](https://fairness.drwhy.ai/) package.

The LTA-HHs team adjusted the Dalex implementation to improve usability and make it suitable for use in the educational sector in the Netherlands. 

## üîß Contributing
