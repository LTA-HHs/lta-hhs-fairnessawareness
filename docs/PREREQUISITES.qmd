This [Npuls CEDA](https://community-data-ai.npuls.nl/groups/view/44d20066-53a8-48c2-b4e9-be348e05d273/project-center-for-educational-data-analytics-ceda){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup> project makes it possible to create a fairness analysis to study equity (*kansengelijkheid*) within progression of students in educational institutions in The Netherlands (mbo, hbo, and wo).

## ðŸŽ“ About

This project is a template for creating a **fairness analysis of students' progression in educational institutions in The Netherlands**. The template is based on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup> framework and uses the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup> coding standard. The template is developed by the [Learning Technology & Analytics (LTA)](https://www.dehaagsehogeschool.nl/onderzoek/lectoraten/learning-technology-analytics){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup> research group of The Hague University of Applied Sciences for the [Npuls CEDA](https://community-data-ai.npuls.nl/groups/view/44d20066-53a8-48c2-b4e9-be348e05d273/project-center-for-educational-data-analytics-ceda){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup> project project.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

These instructions will allow you to install a repository of the project on your local machine to get up and running quickly at the workshop on March 10. 

- **It is important you try to finish these instructions before the session, as it takes quite some time to install the minimal prerequisites, unless you go for the Posit Cloud solution (see below).**
- **To render these reports, you will need to be familiar with git and R.**

## Two flavors: stand alone or Posit Cloud

We have two flavours: a stand-alone installation or a Posit Cloud installation. 

1.  Installation on Posit Cloud is faster since it doesnâ€™t require installing other software except for R packages. But you need a paid subscription to run the project and render the fairness reports to have enough computing power. If you donâ€™t have installation rights on your computer or (want to) work in Posit Cloud anyway, go for this option. 
2.  Otherwise, go for the stand-alone installation and install the software on your computer.

Follow the instructions below, dependent on your choice.

## Stand alone installation

### Prerequisites for stand alone

To start working with this project, make sure you have the following software installed on your local machine following the links provided:

**R, Rstudio, Quarto, XQuartz (for Mac only)**

-   RStudio version 2024.12.0 or higher with R version 4.4.2 or higher - [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>
-   XQuartz 2.8.5 or higher (for Mac only) - [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>
-   Quarto version 1.6.39 or higher - [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>. Since we use the latest Quarto functionalities, you will need at least this version.

**Github, GitHub Desktop**

-   A Github account and (optionally) GitHub Desktop version 3.4.16 - [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>

**GFortran**

-   GFortran - [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>. Installation will take several minutes.

**R packages, fonts**

-   All other packages are installed automatically by running the project `_Setup.R` file on your local machine. Instructions will follow on March 10.
-   The installation of the Liter font is optional. Follow the instructions from Google to install this font. - [Google](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Liter){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>

### Installing the repository

-   Finally, make a fork of the [repository](https://github.com/LTA-HHs/lta-hhs-fairnessawareness/){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup> to your own Github account. 
-   Then clone the repository to your local machine using for instance GitHub Desktop. See [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository){target="_blank"} <sup>ðŸ”—</sup> for an explanation.

## Posit Cloud installation

### Installing the repository

-   Login into Posit Cloud and create a `New Project from Git Repository`. 
-   Copy and paste the following url https://github.com/LTA-HHs/lta-hhs-fairnessawareness/. That's it.  

## ðŸŽˆ All other stuff...

The rest you will learn at March 10, 2025. See you there!
