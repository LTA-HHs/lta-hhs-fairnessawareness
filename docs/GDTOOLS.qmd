You're encountering an error when installing the **gdtools** package in R because the underlying system libraries (**cairo**) are either missing or not properly configured. This issue is common for macOS users working with **Homebrew**.  

### Steps to Fix the Issue:

#### 1. **Check if Homebrew is Installed**
Open your terminal and run:
```sh
brew --version
```
If Homebrew is not installed, install it with:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### 2. **Install the Missing System Dependencies**
Run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
brew install pkg-config cairo freetype
```
This will install **cairo**, **freetype**, and **pkg-config**, which are required for **gdtools**.

#### 3. **Ensure Homebrew Paths are Set Correctly**
After installation, update your environment variables so that R can find these libraries. Run:
```sh
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
If you are using **bash** instead of **zsh**, use:
```sh
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 4. **Verify that `pkg-config` Can Locate Cairo**
Check whether **pkg-config** can find **Cairo** by running:
```sh
pkg-config --cflags --libs cairo
```
If everything is set up correctly, it should return something like:
```
-I/opt/homebrew/include/cairo -I/opt/homebrew/include/freetype2 -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lcairo
```
If this command fails, try:
```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig"
```
and re-run the check.

#### 5. **Reinstall the Package in R**
Restart R and try reinstalling **gdtools**:
```r
install.packages("gdtools", type = "source")
```
Or, if you are using **renv**:
```r
renv::install("gdtools")
```

#### 6. **Restart Your R Session**
Once the package is installed successfully, restart your R session to apply the changes.
